# Trello to Discord

This project can be the solution of all my time management problem (i know that it's not, but let me believe on this :)).
The ideia is get all my tasks on trello and send to discord organized by importance, due date, and board. 
In the future, i want create some commands at discord to filter this informations, like getWeekTasks, 
getTaksFrom(boardName), and others...

- TODO: Get trello boards
- TODO: Get trello cards (tasks) assign to your user id 
- TODO: Organize this cards (tasks) by board and due date
- TODO: Send this cards to discord channel every day


# Possible improvements
- Send a report with tasks completed 
- alert everyone assigned to the card when it is completed
- "- think about what more i can do"
